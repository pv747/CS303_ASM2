# CS303_ASM2

1. Implementation of a Single_Linked_List class with the following functions:
  * push_front(val) => void
    -Adds value to front of list
  * push_back(val) => void
    -Adds value to back of list
  * pop_front() => void
    -Removes value from front of list
  * pop_back() => void
    -Removes value from back of list
  * front() => type T
    -Returns value from front of list
  * back() => type T
    -Returns value from back of list
  * empty() => boolean
    -Returns boolean representative of whether list is empty
  * insert(index, val) => void
    -Inserts specified value at specified index
  * remove(index) => boolean
    -Removes value at specified index
  * find(val) => size_t
    -Finds specified value in list


2. Implementation with a 'Professional' and 'Nonprofessional' class derived from 'Employee' base class. The Employee class contains attributes such as: id, name, total_salary, total_healthcare_contrb and total_vacation_days. total_salary, total_healthcare_contrb_ and total_vacation_days can be accessed using the following: 
  * getTotalSalary() => double
  * getHealthcareContrb() => double
  * getTotalVacationDays() => double

  The derived classes contain the following methods to calculate their salary, healthcare contributions and vacation days earned that week:
  * Professional() / Nonprofessional() constructors
  * calculateWeekSalary() => double
  * calculateHealthcareContrb() => double
  * calculateVacationDays() => double

Driver functions were implemented to show the functions of implemented functions.
