1. Implementation of a Single_Linked_List class with the following functions:
  * push_front(val) => void
  * push_back(val) => void
  * pop_front() => void
  * pop_back() => void
  * front() => type T
  * back() => type T
  * empty() => boolean
  * insert(index, val) => void
  * remove(index) => boolean
  * find(val) => size_t


2. Implementation with a 'Professional' and 'Nonprofessional' class derived from 'Employee' base class. The Employee class contains attributes such as: id, name, total_salary, total_healthcare_contrb and total_vacation_days. total_salary, total_healthcare_contrb_ and total_vacation_days can be accessed using the following: 
  * getTotalSalary()
  * getHealthcareContrb()
  * getTotalVacationDays()

  The derived classes contain the following methods to calculate their salary, healthcare contributions and vacation days earned that week:
